<p>When I wrote the following pages, some years back at Oak Lodge, as a
pastime, I did not think it would be of service to my fellow-creatures,
for our suffering soldiers, the sick, wounded, and needy, who have so
nobly fought our country&#8217;s cause, to maintain the flag of our great
Republic, and to prove among Nations that a Free Republic is not a myth.

<p class="poem"><span class="smcap">Though</span> cooks are often men of pregnant wit,<br />
Through niceness of their subject few have writ.<br />
&#8217;Tis a sage question, if the art of cooks<br />
Is lodg&#8217;d by nature or attain&#8217;d by books?<br />
That man will never frame a noble treat,<br />
Whose whole dependence lies in some <em>receipt</em>.<br />
Then by pure nature everything is spoil&#8217;d,&mdash;<br />
She knows no more than stew&#8217;d, bak&#8217;d, roast, and boil&#8217;d.<br />
When art and nature join, the effect will be,<br />
Some nice <em>ragout</em>, or <em>charming fricasee</em>.<br />
What earth and waters breed, or air inspires,<br />
Man for his palate fits by torturing fires.<br />
But, though my edge be not too nicely set,<br />
Yet I another&#8217;s appetite may whet;<br />
May teach him when to buy, when season&#8217;s pass&#8217;d,<br />
What&#8217;s stale, what choice, what plentiful, what waste,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>And lead him through the various maze of taste.<br />
The fundamental principle of all<br />
Is what ingenious cooks the <em>relish</em> call;<br />
For when the market sends in loads of food,<br />
They all are tasteless till <em>that</em> makes them good.<br />
Besides, &#8217;tis no ignoble piece of care,<br />
To know for whom it is you would prepare.<br />
You&#8217;d please a friend, or reconcile a brother,<br />
A testy father, or a haughty mother;<br />
Would mollify a judge, would cram a squire,<br />
Or else some smiles from court you would desire;<br />
Or would, perhaps, some hasty supper give,<br />
To show the splendid state in which you live.<br />
Pursuant to that interest you propose,<br />
Must all your wines and all your meat be chose.<br />
Tables should be like pictures to the sight,<br />
Some dishes cast in shade, some spread in light;<br />
Some at a distance brighten, some near hand,<br />
Where ease may all their delicace command;<br />
Some should be moved when broken, others last<br />
Through the whole treat, incentive to the taste.<br />
Locket, by many labors feeble grown,<br />
Up from the kitchen call&#8217;d his eldest son;<br />
Though wise thyself (says he), though taught by me,<br />
Yet fix this sentence in thy memory:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>There are some certain things that don&#8217;t excel,<br />
And yet we say are tolerably well.<br />
There&#8217;s many worthy men a lawyer prize,<br />
Whom they distinguish as of middle size,<br />
For pleading well at bar or turning books;<br />
But this is not, my son, the fate of cooks,<br />
From whose mysterious art true pleasure springs,<br />
To stall of garters, and to throne of kings.<br />
A simple scene, a disobliging song,<br />
Which no way to the main design belong,<br />
Or were they absent never would be miss&#8217;d,<br />
Have made a well-wrought comedy be hiss&#8217;d;<br />
So in a feast, no intermediate fault<br />
Will be allow&#8217;d; but if not best, &#8217;tis nought.<br />
If you, perhaps, would try some dish unknown,<br />
Which more peculiarly you&#8217;d make your own,<br />
Like ancient sailors, still regard the coast,&mdash;<br />
By venturing out too far you may be lost.<br />
By roasting that which your forefathers boil&#8217;d,<br />
And broiling what they roasted, much is spoil&#8217;d.<br />
That cook to American palates is complete,<br />
Whose savory hand gives turn to common meat.<br />
Far from your parlor have your kitchen placed,<br />
Dainties may in their working be disgraced.<br />
In private draw your poultry, clean your tripe,<br />
And from your eels their slimy substance wipe.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>Let cruel offices be done by night,<br />
For they who like the thing abhor the sight.<br />
&#8217;Tis by his cleanliness a cook must please;<br />
A kitchen will admit of no disease.<br />
Were Horace, that great master, now alive,<br />
A feast with wit and judgment he&#8217;d contrive,<br />
As thus: Supposing that you would rehearse<br />
A labor&#8217;d work, and every dish a verse,<br />
He&#8217;d say, &#8220;Mend this and t&#8217;other line and this.&#8221;<br />
If after trial it were still amiss,<br />
He&#8217;d bid you give it a new turn of face,<br />
Or set some dish more curious in its place.<br />
If you persist, he would not strive to move<br />
A passion so delightful as self-love.<br />
Cooks garnish out some tables, some they fill,<br />
Or in a prudent mixture show their skill.<br />
Clog not your constant meals; for dishes few<br />
Increase the appetite when choice and new.<br />
E&#8217;en they who will extravagance profess,<br />
Have still an inward hatred for excess.<br />
Meat forced too much, untouch&#8217;d at table lies;<br />
Few care for carving trifles in disguise,<br />
Or that fantastic dish some call <em>surprise</em>.<br />
When pleasures to the eye and palate meet,<br />
That cook has render&#8217;d his great work complete;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>His glory far, like <em>sirloin knighthood</em><a name="FNanchor_XI-1_1" id="FNanchor_XI-1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_XI-1_1" class="fnanchor">xi-1</a> flies<br />
Immortal made, as <em>Kit-cat</em> by his pies.<br />
Next, let discretion moderate your cost,<br />
And when you treat, three courses be the most.<br />
Let never fresh machines your pastry try,<br />
Unless grandees or magistrates are by,<br />
Then you may put <em>a dwarf into a pie</em>.<a name="FNanchor_XI-2_2" id="FNanchor_XI-2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_XI-2_2" class="fnanchor">xi-2</a><br />
Crowd not your table; let your number be<br />
Not more than seven, and never less than three.<br />
&#8217;Tis the <em>dessert</em> that graces all the feast,<br />
For an ill end disparages the rest.<br />
A thousand things well done, and one forgot,<br />
Defaces obligation by that blot.<br />
Make your transparent sweetmeats truly nice<br />
With Indian sugar and Arabian spice.<br />
And let your various creams encircled be<br />
With swelling fruit just ravish&#8217;d from the tree.<br />
The feast now done, discourses are renewed,<br />
And witty arguments with mirth pursued;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>The cheerful master, &#8217;midst his jovial friends,<br />
His glass to their best wishes recommends.<br />
The grace cup follows: To the President&#8217;s health<br />
And to the country; Plenty, Peace, and Wealth!<br />
Performing, then, the piety of grace,<br />
Each man that pleases reassumes his place;<br />
While at his gate, from such abundant store,<br />
He showers his godlike blessings on the poor.</p>

<span style="font-size: 50%;">FOR THE USE OF THE</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 80%;">MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.</span></h2>


<p>The mistress of a family should always remember that the welfare and
good management of the house depend on the eye of the superior, and,
consequently, that nothing is too trifling for her notice, whereby waste
may be avoided.</p>

<p>Many families have owed their prosperity full as much to the conduct and
propriety of female arrangement, as to the knowledge and activity of the
father.</p>

<p>All things likely to be wanted should be in readiness,&mdash;sugars of
different qualities should be broken; currants washed, picked and dry in
a jar; spice pounded, &amp;c. Every article should be kept in that place
best suited to it, as much waste may thereby be avoided. Vegetables<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
will keep best on a stone floor if the air be excluded. Dried meats,
hams, &amp;c., the same. All sorts of seeds for puddings, rice, &amp;c., should
be close-covered, to preserve from insects. Flour should be kept in a
cool, perfectly dry room, and the bag being tied should be changed
upside down and back every week, and well shaken. Carrots, parsnips, and
beet-roots should be kept in sand for winter use, and neither they nor
potatoes be cleared from the earth. Store onions preserve best hung up
in a dry room. Straw to lay apples on should be quite dry, to prevent a
musty taste. Tarragon gives the flavor of French cookery, and in high
gravies should be added only a short time before serving.</p>

<p>Basil, savory, and knotted marjoram, or London thyme, to be used when
herbs are ordered; but with discretion, as they are very pungent.</p>

<p>Celery seeds give the flavor of the plant to soups. Parsley should be
cut close to the stalks, and dried on tins in a very cool oven; it
preserves its flavor and color, and is very useful in winter. Artichoke
bottoms, which have been slowly dried, should be kept in paper bags, and
truffles, lemon-peel, &amp;c., in a very dry place, ticketed.</p>

<p>Pickles and sweetmeats should be preserved from air: where the former
are much used, small jars of each should be taken from the stock-jar, to
prevent frequent opening.</p>

<p>Some of the lemons and oranges used for juice should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span> be pared first, to
preserve the peel dry; some should be halved, and, when squeezed, the
pulp cut out, and the outsides dried for grating.</p>

<p>If for boiling any liquid, the first way is best. When whites of eggs
are used for jelly, or other purposes, contrive to have pudding,
custards, &amp;c., to employ the yolks also.</p>

<p>Gravies or soups put by, should be daily changed into fresh scalded
pans.</p>

<p>If chocolate, coffee, jelly, gruel, bark, &amp;c., be suffered to boil over,
the strength is lost.</p>

<p>The cook should be charged to take care of jelly bags, tapes for the
collared things, &amp;c., which, if not perfectly scalded and kept dry, give
an unpleasant flavor when next used.</p>

<p>Hard water spoils the color of vegetables; a pinch of pearlash or salt
of wormwood will prevent that effect.</p>

<p>When sirloins of beef, loins of veal or mutton come in, part of the suet
may be cut off for puddings, or to clarify; dripping will baste
everything as well as butter, fowls and game excepted; and for kitchen
pies nothing else should be used.</p>

<p>Meat and vegetables that the frost has touched should be soaked in cold
water two or three hours before they are used, or more if much iced;
when put into hot water,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span> or to the fire until thawed, no heat will
dress them properly.</p>

<p>Meat should be well examined when it comes in, in warm weather. In the
height of the summer it is a very safe way to let meat that is to be
salted lie an hour in cold water; then wipe it perfectly dry, and have
ready salt, and rub it thoroughly into every part, leaving a handful
over it besides. Turn it every day and rub the pickle in, which will
make it ready for the table in three or four days; if it is desired to
be very much corned, wrap it in a well-floured cloth, having rubbed it
previously with salt. The latter method will corn fresh beef fit for
table the day it comes in; but it must be put into the pot when the
water boils.</p>

<p>If the weather permits, meat eats much better for hanging two or three
days before it be salted.</p>

<p>The water in which meat has been boiled makes an excellent soup for the
poor, when vegetables, oatmeal, or peas are added, and should not be
cleared from the fat. Roast beef bones, or shank bones of ham, make fine
peas soup, and should be boiled with the peas the day before eaten, that
the fat may be removed. The mistress of the house will find many great
advantages in visiting her larder daily before she orders the bill of
fare; she will see what things require dressing, and thereby guard
against their being spoiled. Many articles may be re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>dressed in a
different form from that in which they are first served, an improve the
appearance of the table without increasing the expense.</p>

<p>In every sort of provisions, the best of the kind goes farthest; cutting
out most advantageously, and affording most nourishment.</p>

<p>Round of beef, fillet of veal, and leg of mutton, bear a higher price;
but having more solid meat, deserve the preference. It is worth notice,
however, that those joints which are inferior may be dressed as
palatably, and being cheaper ought to be bought in turn; and when
weighed with the prime pieces, the price of the latter is reduced.</p>

<p>In loins of meat, the long pipe which runs by the bone should be taken
out, being apt to taint, as likewise the kernels of beef.</p>

<p>Rumps and aitch bones of beef are often bruised by the blows the drovers
give, and that part always taints: avoid purchasing such.</p>

<p>The shank bones of mutton should be saved, and after soaking and
bruising may be added to give richness to gravies and soups, and they
are particularly nourishing for the sick.</p>

<p>Calves&#8217; tongues, salted, make a more useful dish than when dressed with
the brains, which may be served without.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>Some people like neats&#8217; tongues cured with the root, in which case they
look much larger; but should the contrary be approved, the root must be
cut off close to the gullet, next to the tongue, but without taking away
the fat under the tongue. The root must be soaked in salt and water, and
extremely well cleaned before it be dressed; and the tongue laid in salt
for a night and day before pickled.</p>

<p>Great attention is requisite in salting meat, and in the country, where
great quantities are cured, it is of still more importance. Beef and
pork should be well sprinkled, and a few hours after hung to drain,
before it be rubbed with the preserving salts; which mode, by cleansing
the meat from the blood, tends to keep it from tasting strong; it should
be turned daily, and, if wanted soon, rubbed. A salting tub may be used,
and a cover should fit close. Those who use a good deal of salt will
find it well to boil up the pickle, skim, and when cold pour it over
meat that has been sprinkled and drained. In some families great loss is
sustained by the spoiling of meat. If meat is brought from a distance in
warm weather, the butcher should be charged to cover it close, and bring
it early in the morning.</p>

<p>Mutton will keep long, by washing with vinegar the broad end of the leg;
if any damp appears, wipe it immediately. If rubbed with salt lightly,
it will not eat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span> the worse. Game is brought in when not likely to keep a
day, in the cook&#8217;s apprehension, yet may be preserved two or three days
if wanted, by the following method:</p>

<p>If birds (woodcocks and snipes excepted, which must not be drawn), draw
them, pick and take out the crop, wash them in two or three waters, and
rub them with a little salt. Have ready a large saucepan of boiling
water, put the birds in it, and let them remain five minutes, moving it,
that it may go through them. When all are finished, hang them by the
heads in a cold place; when drained, pepper the inside and necks; when
to be roasted, wash, to take off the pepper. The most delicate birds,
even grouse, may be kept this way, if not putrid.</p>

<p>Birds that live by suction, &amp;c., bear being high: it is probable that
the heat might cause them to taint more, as a free passage for the
scalding water could not be obtained.</p>

<p>Fresh-water fish has often a muddy taste, to take off which, soak it in
strong salt and water; or, if of a size to bear it, give it a scald in
the same, after extremely good cleaning and washing.</p>

<p>In the following, and indeed all other receipts, though the quantities
may be as accurately set down as possible, yet much must be left to the
discretion of the persons who use them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>The different taste of people requires more or less of the flavor of
spices, garlic, butter, &amp;c., which can never be directed by general
rules, and if the cook has not a good taste, and attention to that of
her employers, not all the ingredients with which nature or art can
furnish her will give an exquisite relish to her dishes.</p>

<p>The proper articles should be at hand, and she must proportion them
until the true zest be obtained.</p>

<span class="author">Moore.</span></p>

<p>The day before you dress a turtle, chop the herbs, and make the
forcemeat; then, on the preceding evening, suspend the turtle by the two
hind fins with a cord, and put one round the neck with a heavy weight
attached to it to draw out the neck, that the head may be cut off with
more ease; let the turtle hang all night, in which time the blood will
be well drained from the body. Then, early in the morning, having your
stoves and plenty of hot water in readiness, take the turtle, lay it on
the table on its back, and with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> strong pointed knife cut round the
under shell (which is the callipee),&mdash;there are joints at each end,
which must be carefully found,&mdash;gently separating it from the callipash
(which is the upper shell); be careful that in cutting out the gut you
do not break the gall. When the callipee and the callipash are perfectly
separated, take out that part of the gut that leads from the throat;
that with the hearts put into a basin of water by themselves, the other
interior part put away. Take the callipee, and cut off the meat which
adheres to it in four quarters, laying it on a clean dish. Take twenty
pounds of veal, chop it up, and set it in a large pot, as directed for
espagnoles, putting in the flesh of the turtle at the same time, with
all kinds of turtle herbs, carrots, onions, one pound and a half of lean
ham, peppercorns, salt, and a little spice, and two bay leaves, leaving
it to stew till it take the color of espagnole; put the fins&mdash;the skin
scalded off&mdash;and hearts in, half an hour before you fill it, with half
water, and half beef stock, then carefully skim it; put in a bunch of
parsley, and let it boil gently like consomm&eacute;. While the turtle is
stewing, carefully scald the head, the callipee, and all that is soft of
the callipash, attentively observing to take off the smallest skin that
may remain; put them with the gut into a large pot of water to boil till
tender; when so, take them out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> and cut them in squares, putting them in
a basin by themselves till wanted for the soup. The next thing is the
thickening of the soup, which must be prepared in the same manner as
sauce tourn&eacute;e. The turtle being well done, take out the fins and hearts,
and lay them on a dish; the whole of the liquor must pass through a
sieve into a large pan; then with a ladle take off all the fat, put it
into a basin, then mix in the turtle liquor (a small quantity at a
time), with the thickening made the same as tourn&eacute;e; but it does not
require to, neither must it, be one-twentieth part as thick. Set it over
a brisk fire, and continue stirring till it boils. When it has boiled
gently for one hour put in the callipee and callipash with the guts,
hearts, and some of the best of the meat and head, all cut in squares,
with the forcemeat balls and herbs, which you should have ready chopped
and stewed in espagnole; the herbs and parsley, lemon, thyme, marjoram,
basil, savory, and a few chopped mushrooms.</p>

<p>It must be carefully attended to and skimmed, and one hour and a half
before dinner put in a bottle of Madeira wine, and nearly half a bottle
of brandy, keeping it continually boiling gently, and skimming it, then
take a basin, put a little cayenne into it, with the juice of six lemons
squeezed through a sieve. When the dinner is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> wanted, skim the turtle,
stir it well up, and put a little salt, if necessary; then stir the
cayenne and lemon juice in, and ladle it into the tureen. This receipt
will answer for a turtle between fifty and sixty pounds.</p>

squeeze it through the tammy to the rabbits; make it very hot, put in a

<p class="poem"><span class="i9">If you please,<br /></span>
I&#8217;ll taste your tempting toasted cheese,<br />
Broiled ham, and nice <em>mushroom&#8217;d ketchup</em>.</p>

<p>If you love good ketchup, gentle reader, make it yourself, after the
following directions, and you will have a delicious relish for made
dishes, ragouts, soup, sauces, or hashes. Mushroom gravy approaches the
nature and flavor of made gravy, more than any vegetable juice, and is
the superlative substitute for it; in meagre soups and extempore
gravies, the chemistry of the kitchen has yet contrived to agreeably
awaken the palate and encourage the appetite.</p>

<p>A couple quarts of double ketchup, made according to the following
receipt, will save you some score pounds of meat, besides a vast deal of
time and trouble, as it will furnish, in a few minutes, as good sauce as
can be made for either fish, flesh, or fowl. I believe the following is
the best way for preparing and extracting the essence of mushrooms,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> so
as to procure and preserve their flavor for a considerable length of
time.</p>

<p>Look out for mushrooms, from the beginning of September. Take care of
the right sort and fresh gathered. Full-grown flaps are to be preferred.
Put a layer of these at the bottom of a deep earthen pan, and sprinkle
them with salt; then another layer of mushrooms, and some more salt on
them, and so on, alternately, salt and mushrooms; let them remain two or
three hours, by which time the salt will have penetrated the mushrooms,
and rendered them easy to break; then pound them in a mortar, or mash
them well with your hands, and let them remain for a couple of days, not
longer, stirring them up, and mashing them well each day; then pour them
into a stone jar, and to each quart add an ounce and a half of whole
black pepper, and half an ounce of allspice; stop the jar very close,
and set in a stewpan of boiling water, and keep it boiling for two hours
at least.</p>

<p>Take out the jar, and pour the juice, clear from the settlings, through
a hair sieve (without squeezing the mushrooms), into a clean stewpan;
let it boil very gently for half an hour. Those who are for superlative
ketchup, will continue the boiling till the mushroom juice is reduced to
half the quantity. There are several advantages attending this
concentration: it will keep much better, and only half<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> the quantity
required; so you can flavor sauce, &amp;c., without thinning it; neither is
this an extravagant way of making it, for merely the aqueous part is
evaporated. Skim it well, and pour it into a clean dry jar or jug; cover
it close, and let it stand in a cool place till next day; then pour it
off as gently as possible (so as not to disturb the settlings at the
bottom of the jug), through a tamis or thick flannel bag, till it is
perfectly clear; add a tablespoonful of good brandy to each pint of
ketchup, and let it stand as before; a fresh sediment will be deposited,
from which the ketchup is to be quietly poured off and bottled in pints
or half pints (which have been washed in brandy or spirits). It is best
to keep it in such quantities as are soon used.</p>

<p>Take especial care that it is closely corked and sealed down. If kept in
a cool dry place, it may be preserved for a long time; but if it be
badly corked, and kept in a damp place, it will soon spoil.</p>

<p>Examine it from time to time, by placing a strong light behind the neck
of the bottle, and if any pellicle appears about it, boil it up again
with a few peppercorns.</p>

<p>Claret or Port wine and mushroom ketchup, a pint of each; half a pint of
walnut or other pickle liquor; pounded anchovies, four ounces; fresh
lemon-peel, pared very thin, an ounce; peeled and sliced eschalots, the
same; scraped horseradish, ditto; allspice and black pepper, powdered,
half an ounce each; cayenne, one drachm, or curry powder, three drachms;
celery seed, bruised, one drachm; all avoirdupois weight. Put these into
a wide-mouthed bottle, stop it close, shake it every day for a
fortnight, and strain it (when some think it improved by the addition of
a quarter of a pint of soy or thick browning), and you will have &#8220;a
delicious double relish.&#8221; Dr. Kitchener says, this composition is one of
the chefs d&#8217;&#339;uvres of many experiments he has made, for the purpose
of enabling good housewives to prepare their own sauces; it is equally
agreeable with fish, game, poultry, or ragouts, &amp;c.; and as a fair lady
may make it herself, its relish will be not a little augmented, that all
the ingredients are good and wholesome.</p>

<p><em>Obs.</em> Under an infinity of circumstances, a cook<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> may be in want of the
substances necessary to make sauce; the above composition of the several
articles from which the various gravies derive their flavor, will be
found a very admirable extemporaneous substitute. By mixing a large
tablespoonful with a quarter of a pint of thickened melted butter, or
broth, five minutes will finish a boat of very relishing sauce, nearly
equal to drawn gravy, and as likely to put your lingual nerves into good
humor as anything I know.</p>

<p>As to the quality of vegetables, the middle size are preferred to the
largest or smallest; they are more tender, juicy, and full of flavor,
just before they are quite full grown. Freshness is their chief value
and excellence, and I should as soon think of roasting an animal alive,
as of boiling a vegetable after it is dead.</p>

<p>To boil them in soft water will preserve the color best of such as are
green; if you have only hard water, put to it a teaspoonful of carbonate
of potash.</p>

<p>Take care to wash and cleanse them thoroughly from dust, dirt, and
insects. This requires great attention.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>If you wish to have vegetables delicately clean, put on your pot, make
it boil, put a little salt in it, and skim it perfectly clean before you
put in the greens, &amp;c., which should not be put in till the water boils
briskly; the quicker they boil, the greener they will be. When the
vegetables sink, they are generally done enough, if the water has been
kept constantly boiling. Take them up immediately, or they will lose
their color and goodness. Drain the water from them thoroughly before
you send them to table.</p>

and add to them some butter. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> are destroyed by the first frost, but
can be kept during the winter by gathering them on a dry day, when full
grown, but not the least hard, and putting them in their pods into a
keg. Throw some salt into the bottom of the keg, and cover it with a
layer of bean pods, then add more salt, and then another layer of beans
in their pods, till the keg is full. Press them down with a heavy
weight, cover the keg closely, and keep it in a cool, dry place. Before
you use them, soak the pods all night in cold water, the next day shell

<p class="poem">Leeks to the Welsh, to Dutchmen butter&#8217;s dear;<br />

<span class="author">Gay.</span></p>

<p>Wash them, but do not pare or cut them, unless they are very large. Fill
a saucepan half full of potatoes of equal size (or make them so by
dividing the larger ones), put to them as much cold water as will cover
them about an inch; they are sooner boiled, and more savory than when
drowned in water. Most boiled things are spoiled by having too little
water; but potatoes are often spoiled by having too much; they must be
merely covered, and a little allowed for waste in boiling, so that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> they
may be just covered at the finish. Set them on a moderate fire till they
boil; then take them off, and put them by the side of the fire to simmer
slowly till they are soft enough to admit a fork. Place no dependence on
the usual test of their skins cracking, which, if they are boiled fast,
will happen to some potatoes when they are not half done, and the
insides quite hard. Then pour the water off&mdash;(if you let the potatoes
remain in the water a moment after they are done enough, they will
become waxy and watery),&mdash;uncover the <a name="corr4" id="corr4"></a>saucepan, and set it at such a
distance from the fire as will secure it from burning; their superfluous
moisture will evaporate, and the potatoes will be perfectly dry and
mealy.</p>

<p>You may afterwards place a napkin, folded up to the size of the
saucepan&#8217;s diameter, over the potatoes, to keep them hot and mealy till
wanted.</p>

<p>This method of managing potatoes is in every respect equal to steaming
them, and they are dressed in half the time.</p>

<p>There is such an infinite variety of sorts and sizes of potatoes, it is
impossible to say how long they will take doing: the best way is to try
them with a fork. Moderate sized potatoes will generally be done enough
in fifteen or twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Young green peas, well dressed, are among the most delicious delicacies
of the vegetable kingdom. They must be young. It is equally
indispensable that they be fresh gathered, and cooked as soon as they
are shelled, for they soon lose both their color and sweetness. After
being shelled, wash them, drain them in a cullender, put them on, in
plenty of boiling water, with a teaspoonful of salt; boil them till they
become tender, which, if young, will be less than half an hour; if old,
they will require more than an hour. Drain them in a cullender, and put
them into a dish, with a slice of fresh butter in it. Some people think
it an improvement to boil a small bunch of mint with the peas; it is
then minced finely, and laid in small heaps at the end or sides of the
dish. If peas are allowed to stand in the water, after being boiled,
they lose their color.</p>

<p>It is very important to know when the various seasons commence for
picking sweet and savory herbs for drying. Care should be taken that
they are gathered on a dry day, by which means they will have a better
color when dried. Cleanse them well from dirt and dust, cut off the
roots, separate the bunches into smaller ones, and dry them by the heat
of the stove, or in a Dutch oven before a common fire, in such
quantities at a time, that the process may be speedily finished, <em>i. e.</em>
&#8220;Kill &#8217;em quick,&#8221; says a great botanist; by this means their flavor will
be best preserved. There can be no doubt of the propriety of drying,
&amp;c., hastily by the aid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> of artificial heat, rather than by the heat of
the sun. In the application of artificial heat, the only caution
requisite is to avoid burning; and of this a sufficient test is afforded
by the preservation of the color. The best method to preserve the flavor
of aromatic plants is to pick off the leaves as soon as they are dried,
and to pound them, and put them through a hair sieve, and keep them in
well-stopped bottles labelled.</p>

<p>Weigh an equal quantity of flour and butter, rub rather more than half
the flour into one-third of the butter; add as much cold water as will
make it into a stiff paste; work it until the butter be completely mixed
with the flour, make it round, beat it with the rolling-pin, dust it, as
also the rolling-pin with flour, and roll it out towards the opposite
side of the slab, or paste-board, making it of an equal thickness, then
with the point of a knife, put little bits of butter all over it, dust
flour over it and under it, fold in all the sides, and roll it up, dust
it again with flour, beat it a little, and roll out, always rubbing the
rolling-pin with flour, and throwing some underneath the paste to
prevent its sticking to the board.</p>

<p>Make a rich puff paste, roll it out a quarter of an inch thick, cut it
into five or seven pieces with scalloped tin cutters, which go one
within another; leave the bottom and top piece entire, and cut a bit out
of the centre of the others. Place them upon buttered baking tins, and
bake them of a light brown. Build them into a pyramid, laying a
different preserved fruit upon each piece of paste, and on the top a
whole apricot with a sprig of myrtle stuck in it.</p>

<p>Fruit pies for family use are generally made with common paste. Allow
three quarters of a pound of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span> butter to a pound and a half of flour.
Peaches and plums for pies should be cut in half, and the stones taken
out. Cherries also should be stoned, and red cherries only should be
used for pies. Apples should be cut into very thin slices, and are much
improved by a little lemon-peel. Apples stewed previous to baking,
should not be done till they break, but only till they are tender. They
should then be drained in a cullender, and chopped fine with a knife or
edge of a spoon. In making pies of juicy fruit, it is a good way to set
a small teacup on the bottom crust, and lay the fruit round it. The
juice will collect under the cup, and not run out at the edges or top of
the pie. The fruit should be mixed with a sufficient quantity of sugar,
and piled up in the middle, so as to make the pie highest in the centre.</p>

<p>The upper crust should be pricked with a fork. The edges should be
nicely crimped with a knife. If stewed fruit is put in warm, it will
make the paste heavy. If your pies are made in the form of shells, the
fruit should always be stewed first, or it will not be sufficiently
done, as the shells (which should be made of puff paste) must not bake
so long as covered pies.</p>

<p>Fruit pies with lids should have loaf sugar grated over them.</p>

<p>This pudding is especially an excellent accompaniment to a sirloin of
beef. Six tablespoonfuls of flour, three eggs, a teaspoonful of salt,
and a pint of milk, make a middling stiff batter; beat it up well; take
care it is not lumpy. Put a dish under the meat; let the drippings drop
into it, till it is quite hot and well greased; then pour in the batter.
When the upper surface is browned and set, turn it, that both sides may
be brown alike. A pudding an inch thick will take two hours. Serve it
under the roast beef, that the juice of the beef may enter it. It is
very fine.</p>

<p>Mix with six pounds of sifted flour one ounce of salt, nearly half a
pint of fresh sweet yeast as it comes from the brewery, and a sufficient
quantity of warmed milk to make the whole into a stiff dough, work and
knead it well on a board, on which a little flour has been strewed, for
fifteen or twenty minutes, then put it into a deep pan, cover it with a
warmed towel, set it before the fire, and let it rise for an hour and a
half or perhaps two hours; cut off a piece of this sponge or dough;
knead it well for eight or ten minutes, together with flour sufficient
to keep it from adhering to the board, put it into small tins, filling
them three quarters full; dent the rolls all around with a knife, and
let them stand a few minutes before putting them in the oven.</p>

<p>The remainder of the dough must then be worked up for loaves, and baked

together. Boil three pints of milk; pour it boiling upon the meal; add
two teaspoonfuls of salt, and stir the whole very hard. Let it stand
till it becomes of only a lukewarm heat, and then stir in half a pint of

<p>In a large china bowl put a pint of port and a pint of sherry, or other
white wine; sugar to taste. Milk the bowl full; in twenty minutes cover
it pretty high with clouted cream; grate over it nutmeg; put pounded
cinnamon and nonpareil comfits. It is very good without the nonpareil
comfits.</p>

<p class="poem">O, Peggy, Peggy! when thou goest to brew,<br />
Consider well what you&#8217;re about to do;<br />
Be very wise, very sedately think<br />
That what you&#8217;re now going to make is <em>drink</em>;<br />
Consider who must drink that drink, and then<br />
What &#8217;tis to have the praise of <em>honest</em> men;<br />
For surely, Peggy, while that drink does last,<br />
&#8217;Tis Peggy will be <em>toasted or disgraced</em>.<br />
Then if thy <em>ale</em> in glass thou wouldst confine,<br />
To make its sparkling rays in beauty shine,<br />
Let thy clean bottle be entirely dry,<br />
Lest a white substance to the surface fly,<br />
And floating there disturb the curious eye;<br />
But this great maxim must be understood,<br />
&#8220;<em>Be sure, nay very sure, thy cork be good</em>.&#8221;<br />
Then future ages shall of Peggy tell,<br />
That nymph that <em>brewed and bottled ale so well</em>!<br />

<p>Twelve bushels of malt to the hogshead for beer, eight for ale; for
either, pour the whole quantity of water, hot, but not boiling, on at
once, and let it infuse three hours, close covered; mash it in the first
half hour, and let it stand the remainder of the time. Run it on the
hops, previously infused in water; for beer, three quarters of a pound
to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> bushel; if for ale, half a pound. Boil them with the wort, two
hours, from the time it begins to boil. Cool a pailful; then add three
quarts of yeast, which will prepare it for putting to the rest when
ready next day; but, if possible, put together the same night. Sun, as
usual. Cover the bunghole with paper, when the beer has done working;
and when it is to be stopped, have ready a pound and a half of hops,
dried before the fire; put them into the bunghole, and fasten it up.</p>

<p>Let it stand twelve months in casks, and twelve in bottles before it be
drank. It will keep, and be very fine, eight or ten years. It should be
brewed in the beginning of March. Great care must be taken that bottles
are perfectly prepared, and <em>the corks are of the best sort</em>.</p>

<p>The ale will be ready in three or four months, and if the vent-peg be
never removed, it will have spirit and strength to the last. Allow two
gallons of water, at first, for waste.</p>

<p>After the beer or ale is run from the grains, pour a hogshead and a half
for the twelve bushels; and a hogshead of water, if eight were brewed.
Mash, and let stand; and then boil, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="poem">&#8217;Tis said that the gods, on Olympus of old,<br />
<span class="i1">(And who the bright legend profanes with a doubt!)</span><br />
One night, &#8217;mid their revels, by Bacchus were told,<br />
<span class="i1">That his last butt of nectar had somehow run out.</span></p>

<p class="poem">But determined to send round the goblet once more,<br />
<span class="i1">They sued to the fairer mortals for aid</span><br />
In composing a draught, which till drinking were o&#8217;er,<br />
<span class="i1">Should cast every wine ever drank in the shade.</span></p>

<p class="poem">Grave Ceres herself blithely yielded her corn,<br />
<span class="i1">And the spirit that lives in each amber-hued grain,</span><br />
And which first had its birth from the dews of the morn,<br />
<span class="i1">Was taught to steal out in bright dew-drops again.</span></p>

<p class="poem">Pomona, whose choicest of fruits on the board<br />
<span class="i1">Were scattered profusely, in every one&#8217;s reach,</span><br />
When called on a tribute to cull from the hoard,<br />
<span class="i1">Express&#8217;d the mild juice of the delicate peach.</span></p>

<p class="poem"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>The liquids were mingled, while Venus looked on,<br />
<span class="i1">With glances so fraught with sweet magical power,</span><br />
That the honey of Hybla, e&#8217;en when they were gone,<br />
<span class="i1">Has never been missed in the draught from that hour.</span></p>

<p class="poem">Flora then from her bosom of fragrancy shook,<br />
<span class="i1">And with roseate fingers pressed down in the bowl,</span><br />
All dripping and fresh as it came from the brook,<br />
<span class="i1">The <em>herb</em> whose aroma should flavor the whole.</span></p>

<p class="poem">The draught was delicious, each god did exclaim,<br />
<span class="i1">Though something yet wanting they all did bewail;</span><br />
But <em>juleps</em> the drink of immortals became,<br />
<span class="i1">When Jove himself added a handful of hail.</span><br />
